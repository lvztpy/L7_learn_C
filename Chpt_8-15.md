## exercise 12

**If else-if, else and booliean

## exercise 13

**Switch statement

> The *switch-statement* is actually entirely different and is really a "jump table".Instead of random boolean
expressions, you can only put expressions that result in integers, and these integers are used to calculate jumps
from the top of the switch to the part that matches that value.
