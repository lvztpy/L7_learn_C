# creative and defensive programming

**Mind-set**

Defensive programming assumes that you are going to make many mistakes, and then attempts to prevent them at every possible step.



**Never Trust Input** Never trust the data you’re given and always validate it.
**Prevent Errors** If an error is possible, no matter how probable, try to prevent it.
**Fail Early and Openly**Fail early, cleanly, and openly, stating what happened, where, and how to fix it.
**Document Assumptions Clearly** state the pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants.
**Prevention over Documentation** Don’t do with documentation that which can be done with code or avoided completely.
**Automate Everything** Automate everything, especially testing.
**Simplify and Clarify** Always simplify the code to the smallest, cleanest form that works without sacrificing safety.
**Question Authority**  Don’t blindly follow or reject rules.
