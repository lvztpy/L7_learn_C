## Chpt3. Style

Program written only for machine has 2 problems:

### 1.difficult to correct
### 2.maintain not easy

That means comments are very important.

Writing down what you are going to do.

### Your Program should read as an essay

### clear concise and simple

**Heading**  short description, what problem solve
**Author**  
**Purpose** why
**Usage** explain how to run the program
**References** Legicity
**File formats**
**Restriction**
**Rivision history**
**Error handling**
**Notes**

The programmer is the beneficiary of the verbose code.

## Chapter 5 Arrays

(strcpy copies the whole string, including the end-of-string character.)
*strcpy(name, "Sam");*

*fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);
sscanf(line, format, &variable1, &variable2 . . .;*
Here fgets reads a line and sscanf processes it.

## Chapter 6 control flow branching

**Major steps**
^ Requirements
^ Program specifications
^ Code design
^ Coding
^ Testing
^ Debugging
^ Release
^ Maintainance
^ Revision and updating


**The technique is simple: put a *printf* at the points at which you know the data is good**
