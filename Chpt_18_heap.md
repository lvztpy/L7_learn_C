# heap and stack allocation memory

After I typing everything on this exercise, and compiled successfully with no errors.
The thing drives me cary is that when I try to run the program, only got the message "Error memory".
And that is the bug the author set in *line 118* . Even with the instruction , how to break it.
I just can't find the way to fix it. It is something about the function *strncpy*.
I believe the next step is to study more about that function, then try something, after that ,
if stil remains the problem, then I will go directly to the other exercise, then one day I will come back.

## strncpy

strcpy, strncpy - copy a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);

       char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcpy()  function  copies the string pointed to by src, including
       the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer  pointed  to  by  dest.
       The  strings  may  not overlap, and the destination string dest must be
       large enough to receive the copy.  Beware  of  buffer  overruns!   (See
       BUGS.)

## Main idea

The main concept of this chapter is to introduce two ways of allocat memory: **heap** and **stack**.
